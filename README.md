# IDFS-Project: Pathfinding Visualization with Python

This repository presents a pathfinding project utilizing the Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDFS) algorithm. The visualization, created with Tkinter in Python, allows users to interactively observe the algorithm's execution on a map. 

## Features

- *IDFS Algorithm*: Implementing Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search for optimal pathfinding.
- *Tkinter Visualization*: Interactive map visualization with Tkinter for user-friendly experience.
- *Python Implementation*: Built entirely in Python, making it easy to understand and modify.
